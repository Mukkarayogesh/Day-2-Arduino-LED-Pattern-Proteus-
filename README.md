# Day-2-Arduino-LED-Pattern-Proteus-
This project demonstrates a symmetric LED blinking pattern using Arduino UNO. Eight LEDs connected to pins 2–9 turn ON and OFF from the center toward the ends using array indexing and loops. Simulated in Proteus to understand timing, indexing, and pattern control.
